## Create React App

Webpack is an amazing tool that allows us to break our apps down into smaller modules and transform them based on tools called loaders. It's definitely a technology worth looking into, and you should spend some time working through the [Getting Started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) tutorial.

However, webpack is not the focus of this React workshop. We'll instead lean on the opinionated starter kit `create-react-app`, which uses Webpack under the hood.

### create-react-app

Since we should already have node installed, the first thing we need to do is run `npm install -g create-react-app` to install `create-react-app` to the global namespace. From that point, we can use our new cli tool anywhere on our system. Navigate to the folder you want to start a new React project in and run the command `create-react-app my-app`. Then, change directory into my-app (`cd my-app`) From here feel free to take a look around the [documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Important Commands

When you're in a create-react-app project, you might want to actually possibly see the result of the code you're writing! To do this, run this command:

`npm start`

You also might want to deploy your project. Before you do that, you should probably build all of your files so that the code is correctly minified. The code you would have to run in that instance is:

`npm build`
