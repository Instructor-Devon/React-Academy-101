## React & ReactDOM

Your React journey begins with two libraries: `React` and `ReactDOM`.

Go ahead and download them (using npm) and confirm the following objects are available to your JavaScript code.

```bash
# in empty directory
npm init
npm install --save react react-dom
```

### React
The React object is what's going to allow us to create objects that'll eventually become DOM nodes. We need React to create these objects because -- eventually -- we want to take advantage of a system that automatically re-renders UI as our application state changes. If you're not sure what `application state` is, don't worry, we'll talk about that concept in a bit.

### ReactDOM

This is what we'll use to render our UI to the browser.

To create our UI objects (let's start calling them `elements`), we'll use the React.createElement() method.

To render UI to the browser, we'll use the `ReactDOM.render` method.
