## Props

We've created a few React elements, rendered them to the DOM, and wrapped them in functions that we're calling components. That's a lot of conceptual overhead with not a lot to show for it, but don't fret if React doesn't seem especially compelling yet.

We need to add a few more pieces before appreciating its power, one of which is getting comfortable with `props` -- that `React.createElement` parameter we previously set to `null` and promptly forgot about.

`props` is how data flows from a parent to child component in React. For example, say we have two components, App and Title. Both components, again, are just functions that return React elements.
```js
const Title = (props) => {
    return React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hardcoded Title! Boo!');
}
const App = (props) => {
    return React.createElement(Title, null);
}
```
Rather than passing `null` into our `Title` component, let's take advantage of props:
```js
const Title = (props) => {
    const { text } = props; // A little bit of destructuring
    return React.createElement('h1', null, text);
}
const App = (props) => {
    return React.createElement(Title, { text: 'Dynamic content! Hooray!' } );
}
```
`props` will map to the attributes given to our DOM nodes, and we're free to add pretty __much whatever we want__ to that props object. Just remember that, like React elements, `props` are immutable, or read-only. That is, no logic in the Title component can change the `props` that were passed in by App.

You may have already inferred that `props` is what allows us to reuse components and hand down different data:
```js
const Title = (props) => {
    const { text } = props;
    return React.createElement('h1', null, text);
}
const App = (props) => {
    return React.createElement('div', null,
        React.createElement(Title, { text: 'Title one!' } ),
        React.createElement(Title, { text: 'Title two!!' } ),
        React.createElement(Title, { text: 'Title three!!!' } )
  
```
Passing information into components via `props` is how we create dynamic, data-driven UI!
