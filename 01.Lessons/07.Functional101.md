## Functional Programming 101

As you build more React applications, you'll get to know and love a few patterns pulled from functional programming, a style that contrasts with the object-oriented paradigm. You see these functional patterns used in a few places:

- The components you've been using (we'll later name them stateless functional components) are examples of pure functions, a function whose return value is determined only by its input values and which causes no side effects (such as changing the value of a global variable).

- React has embraced the idea of data immutability. You see this with props being a read-only object as well as the heavy use of JavaScript's built-in map and filter methods to build lists of elements.

#### Component architecture gives us a consistency guarantee, much like what's called a pure function in programming: 

#### _With a given set of inputs, the output (how the component looks on the page) will always be the same_

Make sure you've read up a bit on the following methods before moving on:

- [`Array.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [`Array.filter`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
- [`Array.reduce`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce)
- [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
