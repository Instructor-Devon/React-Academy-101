## Prop Events

While `props` gave us the power to create data-driven UI, our apps lack the ability to interact with the user.

But just like the browser offers us hooks that link logic to DOM nodes:
```html
<button onclick="alert('You clicked me!')">Click me!</button>
```
React gives us a similar ability by taking advantage of props that the library is already prepared to handle:

```js
const buttonProps = {
onClick() { alert('You clicked me!'); } // ES6 method definition! See https://developer.mozilla.org/...
}
ReactDOM.render(
React.createElement('button', buttonProps, 'Click me!'),
document.getElementById('content')
);
```
With JSX, this could look like:
```js
ReactDOM.render(
    <button onClick={()=>{alert("You clicked me!")}}>Click me!</button>,
    document.getElementById('content')
);
```
